           <p>I'm a MA psychology student with one foot firmly in empirical psychology, research and psychological statistics, and the other in digital media and information technology. I’m open for research collaboration and freelancing opportunities and looking for employment in San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

          <h3>My objective.</h3>
              <p>
              I'm looking to develop a career in user experience research and analytics in technology. I'm actively searching for opportunities where I would get to utilize my entire skill-set in a driven mixed professional team, while enjoying opportunities to develop professionally - I view learning new technologies on the job a huge benefit.

          <h3>My process.</h3>
              <p>
              Developing a set of interdisciplinary skills is necessary to navigate and survive on the cutting edge of technology. I spend vast amounts of my free time developing a skill set spanning over data-analysis, research methodology and experimental design, web development, programming and writing.

        <div class="mob-whole four columns">
          <h3>My principles.</h3>
              <p>
              I believe in taking intellectual risks, I approach my life and my work with a healthy dose of exploration, and I believe that this healthy combination of ambition and curiosity is what breeds innovation. I believe in self development as a social obligation and in fully committing myself to things that I find important.

                    Anything can be improved with engagement - and what better way to maximize engagement, than to research where it comes from and how to influence it? User experience is about more than just usability - It's about maximizing reach and value through engagement.

                   I think the most insightful type of data science is creative, thought-provoking and methodologically sound while combining a number of different sources. Personally, I'm fascinated by combinations of behavioral artifacts and the ways they can be used in concordance with other sources of data to extract information about users' cognition and motivation.

                    Experimental psychology has been around since the 19th century, but it has only recently started leaking to the cyberspace. The change of domain has implications for methodology and it creates considerations for research design and data-analysis that are not always apparent on first sight.

                 <p>Some participants are excited about your research, but they drop out when they're disappointed with the execution. The first thing you need to do is to polish your user experience to a degree where there is nothing intrinsic to the design that would irritate the user sufficiently to cause them to quit. It is possible that the user will still drop out because the battery is too long or because the task is too difficult, but if they drop out because your instructions are poorly written or because your web page lacks usability, you lose a participant for absolutely no reason.
                 </p>

                 <p>One of the problems cited for web-based experiments is a relatively high rate of participant drop out. In the next three blog posts, we're going to discuss how to minimize drop out and how to maximize participant engagement by using some very simple principles and good habits from product development and customer service. We'll also come up with some more creative ideas on how to keep participants interested and even how to leverage virality to access more participants.

	               <p>Recently, I programmed a set of surveys and cognitive tasks for my master's thesis. For some of the tasks, I used jsPsych - a JavaScript-library for creating web-based experiments, for the back-end I chose Node.js with Express 4.0 and Sequelize. I deployed the experiment on DigitalOceans, and I describe my experience here. If you'd be interested in a series of tutorials on how to deploy jsPsych experiments, throw me an email!

	               <p>
	               Web experiments are excellent for maximizing the scope of a study when it comes to the participant pool. Utilizing web experiments, one can expect very large and diverse samples, which can open doors to addressing hypotheses that simply could not be tested in a lab environment. But as always, this major advantage has to be weighted and considered in light of the shortcomings and challenges of setting up and distributing web-based assessment systems.

	               I recently had a talk about the state of open-source programmable systems for generating experiments for behavioral research. I decided to write up a series of blog posts capturing the most important points of my presentation, involving introductions on a few browser-based systems for creating experiments, a discussion on the challenges and benefits of these web-based solutions, and how the development of programmable behavioral experiments could be improved.

	               I have been working through a book on how to leverage analytics and user segmentation to drive revenue in a freemium business, where the revenue is generated only by a fraction of the user base. The book sparked a wider curiosity towards business analytics that I have been satisfying by going through online courses on topics ranging from Web analytics to databases and map reduce.

	               I spent some time writing a report – although mostly for my own needs – about the main characteristics of some of the most popular children’s game apps on the iOS market, and on the values and characteristics the most prominent companies developing apps for children seem to capitalize on. Reflecting on the topic, I noted a few popular features in children’s apps and games from the most popular publishers.

	               <p>Over time, the blog will cover a colorful range of topics, from game studies and web experiments to usability and AI, but as a general topic, I will be writing about the role of psychology in information technology (and vice versa). Typically an initial response from people to the idea is befuddlement, as amazingly many of them think that people and computers don’t  mix. I wrote this post to disentangle some of the misconceptions.

            <p>If you have wishes for research you would like conducted, or would like to collaborate with me on a project, I'd be happy to hear from you! I’m highly mobile and always looking for challenges related to user experience research, psychometrics, and data-analysis, so if you feel like your project could benefit from a data-driven geek with a background in psychology, send me a message!
